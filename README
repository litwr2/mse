Basic Installation
==================
You need C++ compiler only to build the program.

The simplest way to compile this program is:

  1. Edit makefile to set correct BINDIR for your system.

  2. Type `make' to compile the program.

  3. Optionally, type `make test' to run a self-test that comes with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the program (install documentation 
     manually).

  5. Type `make doc' to create the documentation in both html and pdf
     formats.

  6. Type `make html' to create only `mse.html' documentation.  This step
     uses `tex2html' utility.  See http://litwr2.atspace.eu/mse.html

  7. Type `make pdf' to create only `mse.pdf' documentation.  This step
     uses `texi2pdf' utility of Texinfo package.
     See http://litwr2.atspace.eu/mse.pdf

  8. If you need to generate the documentation in Russian look at README
     in Russian for more information.
